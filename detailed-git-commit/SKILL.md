description: Create accurate Git commits with inspected, detailed commit messages and strict formatting. Use automatically when the user asks to commit changes, stage and commit, create a Git commit, write or amend a detailed commit message, verify the latest commit message, require every body line to start with a hyphen, or ensure the commit subject does not start with punctuation.

# Detailed Git Commit

## Objective

Create one factual Git commit from inspected changes. Commit only the scope the user requested and preserve unrelated work.

The commit subject must not start with a hyphen. Every non-empty body line after the subject must start with `- `.

## Workflow

1. Inspect the repository state with `git status --short`.
2. Read the diff before committing. Use `git diff --stat`, `git diff --cached --stat`, and targeted file diffs or file reads until the behavioural scope is clear.
3. If the user requested staged-only, commit exactly the staged diff. Do not stage additional files.
4. If the user did not specify staged-only, stage only the requested working tree changes. If the scope is ambiguous or unrelated changes look risky to include, ask before staging them.
5. Run `git diff --cached --check` after staging. Fix issues only when they are caused by the requested changes.
6. Write a subject that summarises the whole commit in one sentence and does not start with punctuation.
7. Write detailed body lines. Each body line must start with `- ` and describe a concrete change, risk reduction, test, or documentation update.
8. Commit with `git commit -F -` or an equivalent file-based message path so newlines are preserved exactly.
9. Verify with `git log -1 --pretty=format:%H%n%B` that the subject and all body lines match the required format.
10. Confirm the final worktree state with `git status --short`.

## Message Rules

- Keep the subject concise, imperative, and broad enough to cover the staged diff.
- Do not prefix the subject with `-`, `*`, or a number.
- Start every body line with `- `.
- Do not include blank explanatory paragraphs in the body. Blank separator lines are acceptable only between the subject and body.
- Base every body line on inspected changes. Do not invent tests, migrations, deployment work, or fixes.
- Mention validation only if it was actually run.
- Prefer precise nouns over vague categories like "misc updates".
- If there are no staged or requested changes, do not create an empty commit unless the user explicitly asked for one.

## Commit Command Pattern

Use a literal message body through standard input when practical:

```powershell
@'
Subject without leading hyphen
- First detailed body line.
- Second detailed body line.
- Validation line if checks were run.
'@ | git commit -F -
```

After committing, inspect the saved message. If formatting is wrong and the commit has not been shared, amend it with a corrected message.
